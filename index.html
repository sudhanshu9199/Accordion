            RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. It's a type of database system that stores and organizes data in tables with rows and columns. These tables are linked together based on relationships, making it easy to retrieve and analyze data.

            A constructor is a special type of method within a class that is automatically called when an object of that class is created.
Essentially, it's like a blueprint for how to initialize the object's properties and set its initial state. Constructors help ensure that objects are created in a consistent and predictable manner.</p>

            1. Parameters: These are the placeholders or variables defined within the parentheses of a function or method. They act as inputs that the function expects to receive. <br>
2. Arguments: These are the actual values that are passed to the function when it is called. They are used to fill the placeholders defined by the parameters. <br>
<q>In simpler terms: Imagine a function as a recipe.</q>
Parameters are like the ingredients listed in the recipe (e.g., 2 cups of flour, 1 egg).
Arguments are the actual ingredients you use when you bake (e.g., 2 cups of whole wheat flour, 1 large egg).

            AI, or Artificial Intelligence, refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. This includes things like learning, problem-solving, decision-making, and understanding and responding to language. AI systems can be designed to perform specific tasks, such as playing chess or recognizing speech, or to be more general and flexible, like a human brain.

            Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn from data and improve their performance on a specific task without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms use statistical techniques to identify patterns and relationships in data, enabling them to make predictions or decisions based on new, unseen data.

            Deep learning (DL) is a subfield of machine learning that utilizes artificial neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks) to analyze complex patterns in data. These networks are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, allowing them to learn intricate representations and make highly accurate predictions.
